x represents the number of bits being used 
We subtract one in the exponent because the signed numbers use the last bit for the sign
We subtract one in the expression because 0 is counted as one of the numbers

The result of each rand() is different for all 6 calls
The result of each rand() is only different in the two calls in one execution, then 
	the same two numbers are repeated for the next two executions of the program
The result of the two rand() are the same within the same execution but the 3 	
	pairs are different from each other
