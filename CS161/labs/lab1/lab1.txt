Question 1: Removing the semi-colon made it so when trying to compile the code,
	the terminal gave an error saying that it expected a ';' 

Question 2: After removing the iostream, the terminal said that 'endl' and 'cout'
	were not members of std

Question 3: Removing the "<< std::endl" allowed for it to be compiled and executed but
	when the terminal printed out "Hello World!" then the terminal continued
	on that line and not on the next line

Question 4: The first program simpling prints out "Hello World!" while the second
	program allows the user to have some choice in what is printed

Question 5: Changing the symbol made the terminal say that there was no match for 
	the operator and then it printed out a long list of directories and notes

Question 6: You need to create a variable so that when the user inputs an integer 
	the computer can print that same number back. If there was no variable
	then the integer would just disappear
